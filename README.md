# DAO Voting Smart Contract

The DAO Voting Smart Contract is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that enables its members to create and vote on propositions to release escrowed funds to a designated wallet. The DAO members are required to hold a minimum number of DAO Voting Assets in order to participate in the creation and voting process.

## Smart Contract Parameters

- `voting_asset_id`: A unique identifier for the DAO Voting Assets. Set to 0 to use all ASA's.
- `min_create_votes`: The minimum number of DAO Voting Assets required to create a proposition.
- `min_escrow_votes`: The minimum number of DAO Voting Assets required to escalate a proposition to a vote to release escrowed funds.
- `min_escrow_blocks`: The minimum number of blocks required to pass before a proposition can be escalated to a vote to release escrowed funds.
- `min_release_votes`: The minimum number of DAO Voting Assets required to execute a vote to release escrowed funds.
- `min_release_blocks`: The minimum number of blocks required to pass before a vote to release escrowed funds can be executed.
- `designated_wallet`: The wallet where funds will be transferred if the vote to release escrowed funds is approved.
- `escrowed_funds`: The quantity of funds to be released if the vote to release escrowed funds is approved.
- `asset_ids`: The list of voting asset IDs.
- `vote_counter`: The voting logic.
- `contract`: The contract logic.

## Smart Contract Functions

- `vote()`: Returns the vote counter.
- `execute()`: Executes the contract logic.

## How to Use

To use the DAO Voting Smart Contract, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Algorand account or use an existing one.
2. Create a new DAO Voting Asset or use an existing one.
3. Configure the DAO Voting Smart Contract parameters according to your needs.
4. Deploy the DAO Voting Smart Contract to the Algorand blockchain.
5. Add DAO Voting Assets to your account and transfer them to the DAO Voting Smart Contract.
6. Create a new proposition by calling the DAO Voting Smart Contract with the "create_proposition" argument and providing the proposition details.
7. Escalate the proposition to a vote to release escrowed funds by calling the DAO Voting Smart Contract with the "escalate_proposition" argument.
8. Wait for the minimum number of blocks required for the proposition to be escalated to a vote to release escrowed funds.
9. Vote on the proposition by calling the DAO Voting Smart Contract with the "vote_proposition" argument and providing your vote.
10. Wait for the minimum number of blocks required for the vote to be executed.
11. Execute the vote by calling the DAO Voting Smart Contract with the "execute_vote" argument.
12. The funds will be transferred to the designated wallet if the vote is approved.

## Security Considerations

When deploying and using the DAO Voting Smart Contract, it is important to consider security best practices to ensure the safety of the funds and the integrity of the voting process. Here are some recommendations:

- Thoroughly review and test the smart contract code to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities.
- Set appropriate parameters for the DAO Voting Smart Contract based on the needs of your organization and the amount of funds involved.
- Limit access to the DAO Voting Smart Contract to authorized personnel only.
- Use multi-factor authentication and strong passwords to protect your Algorand accounts.
- Regularly monitor and review the activity on the DAO Voting Smart Contract to detect any suspicious behavior or attempts at
